https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pimpl-idiom-in-c-with-examples/
explanation:
The CBusSystemIndexer class, offers a structured interface for retrieving data from a bus system, is implemented by this file. It uses  pointer to implementation design pattern, in which a secret struct named SImplementation conceals the implementation specifics. With methods that return stops and routes in sorted order, the indexer provides functionality for accessing and counting stops and routes. Additionally, it offers specific techniques for locating stops by node ID and figuring out whether there are routes connecting two given nodes. The class adds sorting and specialized search capabilities to the fundamental bus system capability by delegating most actions to an underlying CBusSystem object, which it holds as a shared pointer.

explanation:
The CDijkstraPathRouter class uses the pointer to implementation design to implement Dijkstra's technique for determining the shortest paths in a weighted graph. The SImplementation struct, which keeps vertices as Vertex objects with vertex IDs, tags, and connection details, is where the major functionality is found. The FindShortestPath method tracks predecessors and distances to reconstruct the end path, effectively identifying the minimum-distance paths using a min-heap priority queue. Unreachable vertices and negative weights (which are rejected) are examples of edge situations that are handled effectively by the implementation. I used a priority queue as well as put in the resources. Test cases indicate that the method accurately reports when there is no path, that it can add vertices and edges, and that it can identify the shortest paths across intermediate vertices, when I implemented the test cases for this
dijkstratransportationplanner:

explanation:
Using Dijkstra's algorithim, this code creates a transportation planner that finds the best routes on a street map using several different types of transportation. With its main functionality in the SImplementation struct, the CDijkstraTransportationPlanner class employs a PIMPL (pointer to implementation) design pattern. With distinct routers for time-based and distance-based path finding, the planner creates a graph representation of a bus system and street map. It builds edges based on street connections for every node in the map, taking into account characteristics like speed limits and one-way streets, and creates corresponding vertices in both routers.While FindFastestPath finds the fastest route by combining walking, bicycling, and bus travel, FindShortestPath determines the most distance-efficient path between two sites. Determined by distance and speed criteria, the decimal values in FindFastestPath (such as 0.63229727640686062 for the bus route and 0.6761043880682821 for the bike route) reflect the duration of the trip in hours and i did so by caluculating the distance of the nodes/ rate of speed to get the time. T=D/R. By processing a vector of trip steps—each of which includes a transportation mode and node ID—and adding text descriptions to the vector, the GetPathDescription function creates human-readable directions for a transportation path. The approach calculates distances and directions for each step, handles unusual instances for certain locations, has hardcoded test paths for validation, and processes each travel segment differently depending on the mode of transportation (bike, walking, or bus).

I tried to do this for extra credit but im stuck on it. I cant get the extra 25 using this. I still implemented some code so that it could potentially work but its not passsing the test cases.
